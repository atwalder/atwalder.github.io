				<li>I recently completed a B.S. degree in computer science at Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI) in Worcester, Massachusetts in May 2018.</li>
				<br>
				<li>I took a leave of absence from WPI for the second semester of the 2015-16 academic year and volunteered 30 hours per week with the Field Engineering and Instrumentation Team at the USGS-CVO (U.S. Geological Survey - Cascades Volcano Observatory).</li>
				<li>I wrote test software in the ‘C’ programming language for a site power management board used with geophysical instruments at USGS field sites on volcanoes in the Pacific Northwest.</li>
				<li>I also worked with large geophysical data sets, applying Python programs to translate and transform raw data into formats that could be utilized by USGS scientists in their work, and assisted with servicing field instrumentation at Mount St. Helens.</li>

					<h2>Major Qualifying Project</h2>
					<p>My senior capstone project (“Major Qualifying Project” or MQP in WPI jargon) was in support of a research program to develop an Android application for a study of the effectiveness of music as an alternative to opiates in treatment of chronic pain.</p>

					<h2>Interactive Qualifying Project</h2>
					<p>The interactive qualifying project (IQP) is required of every WPI undergraduate student and involves working with an interdisciplinary team to address a problem or need that lies at the intersection of technology and society. Commonly the IQP is not closely related to the student’s major field of study. My IQP involved four students working with a community arts organization to find ways to improve their operations.</p>
