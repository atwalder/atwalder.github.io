				<h1 class="display-5">The IMAGS App</h1>
				<p>The IMAGS App my partner and I created is a mobile Android application that allows the comparison in the study of the effectiveness of music as an alternative to opiates in the treatment of chronic pain. The project spanned from September 2017 to April 2018. The project, done in collaboration with another student, was in support of a research program known as Music-induced Analgesia Genome Study, or IMAGS. The aim of the research is to determine if there are certain motifs in music, such as key, tempo, or chord progressions, which correlate with a patientâ€™s perception of reduced pain, and whether such motifs are universally applicable or specific to each individual. The project involved integrating the Spotify music-streaming service into an Android app using the Spotify Android SDK. Spotify metadata were collected along with patient-generated data related to perception of pain; data were stored locally on a mobile device using SQLite; and Volley was used to send data through HTTP POST requests to a PHP script that accesses a created MySQL database on a WPI server. My partner and I completed a written project report and poster presentation detailing our application and its development.</p>
